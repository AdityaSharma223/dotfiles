# Dotfiles  

Dotfiles are how you customize and configure your system and it's components. 

These are the dotfiles of some of the applications and utilities I use: 

- NeoVim (Text editor)
	- Make sure you have [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed beforehand (too lazy to add an auto download script at the top of the config)
- fish (Shell)
- Alacritty (Terminal emulator)
- Ranger (Terminal based file manager) 
- Zathura (pdf reader)
- qtile (window manager) (Arco linux base cofig with changes)
