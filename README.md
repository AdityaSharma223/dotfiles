# Dotfiles  

Dotfiles are how you customize and configure your system and it's components. 

These are the dotfiles of some of the applications and utilities I use: 

- NeoVim (Text editor)
	- Make sure you have [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed beforehand
- fish (Shell)
- Alacritty (Terminal emulator)
- Ranger (Terminal based file manager)
