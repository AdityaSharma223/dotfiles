# Dotfiles 

Dotfiles are how you customize and configure your system and it's components. 

These are the dotfiles of all the applications and utilities I use: 

- [NeoVim](https://github.com/AdityaSharma223/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim) (Text editor)
- [zsh](https://github.com/AdityaSharma223/dotfiles/tree/main/zsh) (Shell)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/AdityaSharma223/dotfiles/tree/main/alacritty) (Terminal emulator)
- [Ranger](https://github.com/AdityaSharma223/dotfiles/tree/main/ranger) (Terminal based file manager)
